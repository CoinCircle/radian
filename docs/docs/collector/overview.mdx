# Overview

The collector is the core component of the Radian Protocol, and acts as a treasury,
yield generation system, an oracle, and a burning mechanism all at the same time.

Fee-generating modules of the Radian Protocl such as the [Radian Exchange](/docs/radian-exchange),
the [Radian Paymaster](/docs/radian-paymaster), [Radian Lending](/docs/radian-lending),
the [USDX Stablecoin](/docs/usdx-stablecoin), and [Radian Staking](/docs/staking)
all send a portion of the fees generated to the collector.

Holders of RAD can, at any time, burn RAD in exchange for the underlying assets
in the collector, relative to the total supply. This means that at any time,
if the per-RAD value of the underlying assets in the collector is greater than
price of RAD, there is an arbitrage opportunity to burn RAD and sell the underlying
assets for a profit. This is a win-win for other holders as it decreases the total
supply of RAD, and increases the value of the remaining RAD.

## Transfers and RADX

Unlike your typical ERC20 token, the RAD token is not transferrable outside of
the Radian Protocol. This is due to the fact that RAD is a rebasing token similar
to stETH, and also due to the fact that RAD has a pricing function that is
proportional to the value of the underlying assets within the Radian Exchange.

For these reasons, RAD can be converted to RADX, which is a transferrable ERC20
token. The RADX token is a 1:1 representation of the RAD token, and can be
converted back to RAD at any time.

To give a more technical description, RAD token transfers require either the "from" or
"to" address to be some contract of the protocol itself. This means it can be
transferred from the protocol to your wallet, but not from your wallet to another
wallet (however you will still be able to transfer it back to the protocol).

## Governance

The RAD token is also the governance token of the Radian Protocol. It is used to
vote on proposals, and to stake for the Radian Staking module.
