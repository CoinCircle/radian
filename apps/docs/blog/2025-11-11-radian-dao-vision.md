As we enter 2025, Radian Protocol is embarking on a transformative journey toward complete decentralization. What started as a vision to build radical, autonomous, decentralized financial infrastructure is now evolving into a truly community-governed protocol.

<!--truncate-->

## The Vision

Radian Protocol was built from day one with a singular focus: creating permissionless, composable DeFi primitives that put power back in the hands of users. Our exchange infrastructure, perpetuals engine, money markets, and stablecoin mechanisms aren't just products—they're building blocks for the next generation of decentralized finance.

But building the technology is only half the story. True decentralization requires giving the community real ownership and control over the protocol's future.

## Enter Radian DAO

The Radian DAO represents the next chapter of our evolution. Through [Snapshot governance](https://snapshot.box/#/s:radiandao.eth), RAD token holders will have direct voting power over:

- **Protocol upgrades and improvements**
- **Treasury management and allocation**
- **Parameter adjustments across all Radian products**
- **Strategic partnerships and integrations**
- **Community grants and incentive programs**

Snapshot provides a gas-free, transparent voting mechanism where every decision is recorded on-chain while keeping governance accessible and efficient. Proposals are discussed, debated, and decided by the community—not a centralized team.

## What This Means

This transition isn't about stepping back—it's about stepping up. The protocol's future will be shaped by those who use it, build on it, and believe in its mission. The most innovative ideas often come from unexpected places, and by empowering the community, we unlock exponentially more potential than any single team ever could.

The transition is already underway. The DAO structure is live, governance mechanisms are being tested, and the community is actively participating in shaping Radian's roadmap.

## The Road Ahead

Decentralization is a journey, not a destination. Over the coming months, we'll progressively hand over more control:

1. **Initial governance** - Community input on non-critical parameters
2. **Expanded authority** - DAO control over protocol upgrades
3. **Full autonomy** - Complete community governance with multi-sig oversight
4. **True decentralization** - Immutable smart contracts, pure on-chain governance

This is what we've been building toward. Not just another DeFi protocol, but a genuinely decentralized financial infrastructure owned and operated by its users.

The future is radically autonomous. The future is decentralized. The future is Radian DAO.
